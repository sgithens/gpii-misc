NVDA currently only supports computer braille input so only 8 dot computer braille tables will be shown. You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys. Note that this option is only useful if your braille display has a Perkins-style keyboard and this feature is supported by the braille display driver. If input is not supported on a display which does have a braille keyboard this will be noted in the Supported Braille Displays section.","en-ueb-g1.ctb",,"[""ar-ar-g1.utb"",""as-in-g1.utb"",""be-in-g1.utb"",""bg.ctb"",""ckb-g1.ctb"",""cy-cy-g1.utb"",""cy-cy-g2.ctb"",""cs-comp8.utb"",""cs-g1.ctb"",""da-dk-g08.ctb"",""da-dk-g16.ctb"",""da-dk-g18.ctb"",""da-dk-g26.ctb"",""da-dk-g28.ctb"",""de-de-comp8.ctb"",""de-de-g0.utb"",""de-de-g1.ctb"",""de-de-g2.ctb"",""el.ctb"",""en-gb-comp8.ctb"",""en-gb-g1.utb"",""en-GB-g2.ctb"",""en-ueb-g1.ctb"",""en-ueb-g2.ctb"",""en-us-comp6.ctb"",""en-us-comp8-ext.utb"",""en-us-g1.ctb"",""en-us-g2.ctb"",""eo-g1.ctb"",""Es-Es-G0.utb"",""es-g1.ctb"",""et-g0.utb"",""ethio-g1.ctb"",""fa-ir-comp8.ctb"",""fa-ir-g1.utb"",""fi.utb"",""fi-fi-8dot.ctb"",""fr-bfu-comp6.utb"",""fr-bfu-comp8.utb"",""fr-bfu-g2.ctb"",""ga-g1.utb"",""ga-g2.ctb"",""gu-in-g1.utb"",""gr-bb.ctb"",""he.ctb"",""hi-in-g1.utb"",""hr-comp8.utb"",""hr-g1.ctb"",""hu-hu-comp8.ctb"",""hu-hu-g1.ctb"",""hu-hu-g2.ctb"",""is.ctb"",""it-it-comp6.utb"",""it-it-comp8.utb"",""ka-in-g1.utb"",""ko-2006-g1.ctb"",""ko-2006-g2.ctb"",""ko-g1.ctb"",""ko-g2.ctb"",""ks-in-g1.utb"",""lt.ctb"",""lt-6dot.utb"",""Lv-Lv-g1.utb"",""ml-in-g1.utb"",""mn-in-g1.utb"",""mn-MN-g1.utb"",""mn-MN-g2.ctb"",""mr-in-g1.utb"",""nl-BE-g0.utb"",""nl-NL-g0.utb"",""no-no-comp8.ctb"",""No-No-g0.utb"",""No-No-g1.ctb"",""No-No-g2.ctb"",""No-No-g3.ctb"",""np-in-g1.utb"",""or-in-g1.utb"",""pl-pl-comp8.ctb"",""Pl-Pl-g1.utb"",""pt-pt-comp8.ctb"",""Pt-Pt-g1.utb"",""Pt-Pt-g2.ctb"",""pu-in-g1.utb"",""ro.ctb"",""ru.ctb"",""ru-ru-g1.utb"",""sa-in-g1.utb"",""Se-Se.ctb"",""Se-Se-g1.utb"",""sk-g1.ctb"",""sl-si-comp8.ctb"",""sl-si-g1.utb"",""sr-g1.ctb"",""ta-ta-g1.ctb"",""te-in-g1.utb"",""tr.ctb"",""uk.utb"",""unicode-braille.utb"",""vi-g1.ctb"",""zhcn-g1.ctb"",""zhcn-g2.ctb"",""zh-hk.ctb"",""zh-tw.ctb""]","[""Arabic grade 1"",""Assamese grade 1"",""Bengali grade 1"",""Bulgarian 8 dot computer braille"",""Central Kurdish grade 1"",""Welsh grade 1"",""Welsh grade 2"",""Czech 8 dot computer braille"",""Czech grade 1"",""Danish 8 dot computer braille"",""Danish 6 dot grade 1"",""Danish 8 dot grade 1"",""Danish 6 dot grade 2"",""Danish 8 dot grade 2"",""German 8 dot computer braille"",""German grade 0"",""German grade 1"",""German grade 2"",""Greek (Greece)"",""English (U.K.) 8 dot computer braille"",""English (U.K.) grade 1"",""English (U.K.) grade 2"",""Unified English Braille Code grade 1"",""Unified English Braille Code grade 2"",""English (U.S.) 6 dot computer braille"",""English (U.S.) 8 dot computer braille"",""English (U.S.) grade 1"",""English (U.S.) grade 2"",""Esperanto grade 1"",""Spanish 8 dot computer braille"",""Spanish grade 1"",""Estonian grade 0"",""Ethiopic grade 1"",""Persian 8 dot computer braille"",""Persian grade 1"",""Finnish 6 dot"",""Finnish 8 dot computer braille"",""French (unified) 6 dot computer braille"",""French (unified) 8 dot computer braille"",""French (unified) grade 2"",""Irish grade 1"",""Irish grade 2"",""Gujarati grade 1"",""Koine Greek"",""Hebrew 8 dot computer braille"",""Hindi grade 1"",""Croatian 8 dot computer braille"",""Croatian grade 1"",""Hungarian 8 dot computer braille"",""Hungarian grade 1"",""Hungarian grade 2"",""Icelandic 8 dot computer braille"",""Italian 6 dot computer braille"",""Italian 8 dot computer braille"",""Kannada grade 1"",""Korean grade 1 (2006)"",""Korean grade 2 (2006)"",""Korean grade 1"",""Korean grade 2"",""Kashmiri grade 1"",""Lithuanian 8 dot"",""Lithuanian 6 dot"",""Latvian grade 1"",""Malayalam grade 1"",""Manipuri grade 1"",""Mongolian grade 1"",""Mongolian grade 2"",""Marathi grade 1"",""Dutch (Belgium)"",""Dutch (Netherlands)"",""Norwegian 8 dot computer braille"",""Norwegian grade 0"",""Norwegian grade 1"",""Norwegian grade 2"",""Norwegian grade 3"",""Nepali grade 1"",""Oriya grade 1"",""Polish 8 dot computer braille"",""Polish grade 1"",""Portuguese 8 dot computer braille"",""Portuguese grade 1"",""Portuguese grade 2"",""Punjabi grade 1"",""Romanian"",""Russian braille for computer code"",""Russian grade 1"",""Sanskrit grade 1"",""Swedish 8 dot computer braille"",""Swedish grade 1"",""Slovak grade 1"",""Slovenian 8 dot computer braille"",""Slovenian grade 1"",""Serbian grade 1"",""Tamil grade 1"",""Telugu grade 1"",""Turkish grade 1"",""Ukrainian"",""Unicode braille"",""Vietnamese grade 1"",""Chinese (China Mandarin) grade 1"",""Chinese (China Mandarin) grade 2"",""Chinese (Hong Kong Cantonese)"",""Chinese (Taiwan Mandarin)""]",,,,,"{""title"":""Input Table"",""description"":""Complementary to the output table option.
